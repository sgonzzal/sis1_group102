    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to study the response of FIR filters to inputs such as complex exponentials and sinusoids. In the experiments of this lab, you will use `np.convolve()` to implement filters and `freqz()` to obtain the filter’s frequency response. As a result, you should learn how to characterize a filter by knowing how it reacts to different frequency components in the input.\n",
    "This lab also introduces two practical filters: bandpass filters and nulling filters.\n",
    "Bandpass filters can be used to detect and extract information from complex signals,\n",
    "e.g., tones in a touch-tone telephone dialer. Nulling filters can be used to remove\n",
    "sinusoidal interference, e.g., jamming signals in a radar."
